# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Proyect

This proyect consist on a resizeable grid of divs which changes color when hovered, to simulate a drawing board. The grid can be reset and resized up to 100 squares (divs), and the color of the 'paint' can be changed with an rgb value or selecting a predetermined one.

The project is meant to put to practise what I have leart during the course.

This includes: DOM manipulation, event listeners, writing clean code, arrays, loops, etc.
